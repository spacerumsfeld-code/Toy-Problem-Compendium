/* Welcome to the Arrays section of the "Top Interview Questions" module of l33tcode.
These problems will all pertain to, you guessed it, arrays.

The point of these exercises is not to simply whip up a solution as fast as possible;
take as much time as needed during the brainstorming segment of your problem-solving process
and try to really get into the weeds of what your code is telling the machine to do, including
the time and space complexity of said code.

The overarching goal is a deeper-seated understanding of the implications of different
instructions to a machine (i.e., code), as well as, of course, sharpening one's interview
skills.

The problems are delimited by difficulty level. Here are the problems, in order:
